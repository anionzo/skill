> 🎯 Keep repeatable AI workflows in one place. Separate skills from knowledge. Work across any agent.

This repo is intentionally lighter than a full workflow product. It borrows the **workflow-first** mindset from `hoangnb24/skills`, the **plan-first** behavior from modern coding agents like OpenCode, and the **multi-platform** approach from `knowns-dev/knowns` — then turns them into a practical personal library.

The current library is intentionally consolidated: it keeps **13 higher-signal skills** instead of splitting every adjacent workflow into separate names. Overlapping flows such as repo onboarding, session handoff, and end-to-end go mode are folded into stronger core skills (`research`, `extract`, and `planning`) to reduce routing noise.

### 🏗️ Design Goals

| | Goal |
|---|---|
| 🔹 | Skills are small, specific, and reusable |
| 🔹 | Knowledge is stored separately from skills |
| 🔹 | Adapters are generated from one source — not hand-maintained |
| 🔹 | Works without any custom plugin runtime |

### 📁 Repository Layout

```
.
├─ 📄 docs/                 → Specs, authoring rules, design decisions
├─ 🎯 skills/               → Reusable skill definitions
├─ 📚 knowledge/            → Global, project, and working knowledge
├─ 📋 templates/            → Starting points for new skills
├─ 🔌 adapters/             → Platform-specific guidance
├─ ⚙️ scripts/              → Validation and sync helpers
├─ 🌐 i18n/                 → Vietnamese translations
└─ 📦 generated/            → Auto-generated output (gitignored)
```

### 🎯 Skill Catalog

This catalog is intentionally compact: each skill should own a clearly distinct job, and nearby workflows are merged unless the risk profile or working mode is meaningfully different.

| | Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 🧭 | `using-skills` | Route a request to the right skill and working mode |
| 💡 | `brainstorming` | Explore ideas, lock decisions, optionally write a spec |
| 🔎 | `research` | Explore existing code and patterns before implementing |
| 📐 | `planning` | Execution-ready plans, plus optional go-mode execution for approved work |
| 🚀 | `feature-delivery` | Implement a feature with minimal, repo-aligned change |
| 🧪 | `test-driven-development` | Enforce test-first discipline with red-green-refactor |
| 🐛 | `debug` | 4-phase systematic debugging with root cause investigation |
| ♻️ | `refactor-safe` | Restructure code without changing behavior |
| ✅ | `verification-before-completion` | Iron law: no completion claims without fresh evidence |
| 🔍 | `code-review` | Give and receive code reviews with severity triage |
| 📝 | `commit` | Create conventional commits with staged change review |
| 📖 | `docs-writer` | Update docs from verified source behavior |
| 🧬 | `extract` | Extract durable learnings or compress active work into a handoff |

### 📖 Research Highlights

This scaffold distills patterns from strong public repos:

| Source | Key Pattern |
|---|---|
| 🏛️ [`anthropics/skills`](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) | Minimal, portable skill packaging |
| ⚡ [`obra/superpowers`](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) | Brainstorm → plan → execute → verify workflow |
| 🧩 [`affaan-m/everything-claude-code`](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code) | Layered model: skills, rules, memory, adapters |
| 🗃️ [`knowns-dev/knowns`](https://github.com/knowns-dev/knowns) | Separate skills from knowledge; generate platform files |
| 📦 [`hoangnb24/skills`](https://github.com/hoangnb24/skills) | Workflow-first skill design with router and output contracts |

### 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Understand the repo shape
cat docs/design-brief.md

# 2. Customize knowledge to your preferences
vim knowledge/global/engineering-principles.md

# 3. Start working — the router picks the right skill
cat skills/using-skills/SKILL.md

# 4. Validate your skills
bash scripts/validate-skills

# 5. Generate platform files
bash scripts/sync-platform-files
```

### 📦 Install via npm

> Available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anionzo/skill) — no authentication required

```bash
# Recommended: one command, no package.json created
npx @anionzo/skill
```

Or add as a project dependency (creates package.json):

```bash
npm install @anionzo/skill
```

Skills are automatically installed into:

- `.opencode/skills/` — for OpenCode
- `.claude/skills/` — for Claude Code
- `.agents/skills/` — for other agents

Open your agent and use `/skill` to see available skills.

> 💡 Or clone the repo directly if you prefer editing skills in place.
